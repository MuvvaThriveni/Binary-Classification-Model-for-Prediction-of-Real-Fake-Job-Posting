# Real-Fake Job Postings Classifier

## Overview

This repository contains a binary classification predictive model to identify Real-Fake Job Postings. The model is built using various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and ExtraTreesClassifier. Hyperparameter tuning was implemented using GridsearchCV to optimize model performance. The evaluation of the model was done based on recall score (97.4%) and precision (98.4%).

## Features
